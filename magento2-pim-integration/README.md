Magento 2 PIM Integration
==================
A base module for use in building integrations with PIMs or their like.

This module doesn't do anything on its own but hosts PIM-agnostic functionality that can be shared.
See ripenecommerce/magento2-catsy-integration for the initial reference implementation.
